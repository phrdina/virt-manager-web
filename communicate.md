# Communicate

## Mailing lists

The project no longer uses mailing lists for discussion.
[The archives](https://lists.virt-tools.org/) are still available to
preserve the historical record.

For bug reports and user questions, please see the [Bugs](bugs.html) page.

## IRC

Developers can sometimes be found in the #virt channel on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/)
